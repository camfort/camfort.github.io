    <a href="https://github.com/camfort/camfort/releases/tag/v1.1.1">v1.1.1 of CamFort has been released</a>,
    bringing back Windows+Mac support. We also have some

  <li><b>March 2021</b> - <a href="https://github.com/camfort/camfort/releases/tag/v1.0.1">
  v1.0.1 of CamFort has been released</a>, mostly updated CamFort to
  work with latest dependencies. This also includes new versions of
  our core libraries:
  <ul>
    <li><a
  href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fortran-src">fortran-src</a>
    v0.4.2</li>
    <li><a
  href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/verifiable-expressions">
    verifiable-expressions</a> v0.6.1
    </li>
  </ul>
  And we have a new Research Assistant, Ben Orchard, working on the
  project!<br />

<li><b>November 2020</b> - Dominic is talking about our work at the
<a
href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2020?plenary=Hide%20plenary%20sessions#program">
workshop on Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants</a>
colocated with SPLASH 2020, talking about <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06094">Guiding
user annotations for units-of-measure verification</a> (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06094">pdf</a>).<br />

  <li><b>30th August 2019</b> -
    <a href="https://github.com/camfort/camfort/releases/tag/v1.0">
      v1.0 of CamFort has been released
    </a>. The main changes are:
    <ul>
      <li>Update to new fortran-src version 0.4.0.</li>
      <li>New command: basic-checks, which runs a series of other checks in Simple.hs.</li>
      <li>Add max-lines threshold for snippets output, currently 5.</li>
      <li>Rename units-compile to units-summarise/summarize.</li>
      <li>Bring over same command-line flexibility to units-compile as 'fortran-src -c', can specify multiple files-or-directories.</li>
      <li>Use ModGraph functionality to allow units-summarise to build dependency graphs and summarise in build-order.</li>
      <li>Search includedir recursively for mod-files, like fortran-src.</li>
      <li>Numerous changes to increase strictness and reduce memory usage: use Pipes, avoid constructing needlessly large graphs.</li>
      <li>A Linux x86-64 binary bundle is available for download from the release webpage.</li>
    </ul><br>
  </li>

  <li><b>17th June 2019</b> -
    <a href="https://github.com/camfort/camfort/releases/tag/v0.906">
      v0.906 of CamFort has been released
    </a>. The main changes are:
    <ul>
      <li>Update to new fortran-src version 0.3.0.</li>
      <li>Add array-check, alloc-check, use-check, fp-check and implicit-none features.</li>
      <li>A collection of sanity checks on Fortran code looking for common issues, possible problems or potential inefficiencies.</li>
      <li>Introduce a divide-and-conquer methodology for solving units-inference problems, reducing the size of the matrices and taking advantage of SMP where available.</li>
      <li>Treat constant-expressions and parameter variables as literals, for units-inference purposes, making it easier to retrofit units annotations onto existing programs.</li>
      <li>Add 'units-infer --show-ast' feature, which decorates the displayed AST (internal data structure) with units information on each expression.</li>
      <li>Made assorted efficiency improvements to the units solver and other features, especially for large projects with many files.</li>
      <li>Add 'units-check --dump-mod-file' feature that lets you view an 'fsmod' file's contents with regard to units info.</li>
      <li>Allow override of Fortran version used by parser using -F option.</li>
    </ul><br>
